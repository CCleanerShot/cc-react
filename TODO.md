# TODO

-   [x] conditionally re-rendering based on what is actually updated
-   [x] useCallback
-   [x] useEffect
-   [x] useMemo
-   [x] useRef
-   [ ] add same bug that doesn't render boolean values properly without `.toString()`
-   [x] upload as npm package
-   [ ] add unit tests
-   [ ] add optional cdn script instead of the user needing to bundle their module of `cc-react` (react also offers this)
-   [ ] package types match similarly to the one in React
